# JointOpt2

In this depository we have:

The simulation code  FGASLJ1DbarTEPS.m

The raw optimization main.m (using finite differences and nl constraints)

the MultiStart optimization main_ms.m (need global optimization toolbox)

Need to: 

add a new objective function (such as min variance)
treat constraints as linear : Ax=B
Remove the constraint3 (redundant)
